#### 1. **Use Your Dice Wisely**

Your dice are a crucial resource in *Monopoly GO*. Since you received free dice, make sure to use them strategically to move around the board and acquire properties. Sometimes, you may need to hold on to them for the right moment to land on a valuable spot or avoid the dreaded *Go to Jail* square.

#### 2. **Focus on Property Sets**

In *Monopoly GO*, owning a complete property set allows you to build houses and increase the rent you collect from opponents. The more sets you complete, the more money youâ€™ll make. So, focus on completing property sets early in the game, and donâ€™t be afraid to make trades with other players to fill in the gaps.

#### 3. **Master the Auctions**

Whenever properties are up for auction, jump on the opportunity to grab them. Auctions can be a great way to acquire properties that you wouldnâ€™t otherwise be able to purchase. Just be cautious not to overspendâ€”you donâ€™t want to break the bank early on.

#### 4. **Keep an Eye on Special Events**

*Monopoly GO* regularly features special events and limited-time challenges. Participating in these events can earn you extra rewards, including more dice, money, and even rare properties. Always check the event calendar to see whatâ€™s happening in the game.

#### 5. **Know When to Build and When to Save**

Building houses on your properties is a great way to boost your income. However, sometimes itâ€™s better to hold off on building and save up for bigger investments. Plan ahead and consider your long-term strategy when making financial decisions in the game.
